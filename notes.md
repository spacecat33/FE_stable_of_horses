- When: when the event should be able to trigger or when to cause the event
- Cause: What we do to interact with the event such as a click or keypress
- Effect: What happens after we trigger the event or interact with the event

If it belongs to a model class - put it in the model class. Take your time to translate all the invoking (or calling of the function) to that class or instance.
