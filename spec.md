This is created for a Flatiron School Portfolio Project:

[X]   In order to demonstrate your proficiency with what you've learned about web development with JavaScript, here are the requirements for your project. You should view these guidelines as a minimum bar for the features you include in your application. It's your project, and you are encouraged to go above and beyond these requirements.

[X]  The application must be an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend. All interactions between the client and the server must be handled asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format.

[X]  The JavaScript application must use Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior.

[X]  The domain model served by the Rails backend must include a resource with at least one has-many relationship. For example, if you were building an Instagram clone, you might display a list of photos with associated comments.

[X]  The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. Your application should have at least 3 AJAX calls, covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.

---

JavaScript
[X] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
[X] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
[X] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax).


Rails
[X] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /puppies ought to be handled by the PuppiesController, fetch puppies from the database using a Puppy Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
[X] Well-named variables and methods
[X] Short, single-purpose methods


Git
[X] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
[X] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
[X] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
